    <h2>A brief summary of Paul Kim's life so far</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Paul Kim. I've been told that my story is
      <em>very</em> unusual; to save you some time, I've condensed it to the
      following! Born to Canadian-Korean parents in Seoul, Korea, I was schooled
      in English at Seoul Foreign School. In 2002, we emigrated back to Canada
      and I spent 2 years in Quebec where I learned a bit of French. In 2004, I
      moved to Vancouver for the rest of secondary school and entered UBC in
      2008. Graduating <em>far</em> too late (2014), I briefly worked as a
      technical writer and then worked for an IT company in the UK in 2018. I
      returned and found employment difficult, so I decided to bite the bullet
      and properly learn IT!
