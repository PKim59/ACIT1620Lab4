    <h2>The Story of Paul Kim's</h2>
    <p>My name is Paul Kim. I've been told that my story is <em>very</em> unusual; to save you some time, I've condensed it to the following! Born to Canadian-Korean parents in Seoul, Korea, I was schooled in English at Seoul Foreign School. In 2002, we emigrated back to Canada and I spent 2 years in Quebec where I learned a bit of French. In 2004, I moved to Vancouver for the rest of secondary school and entered UBC in 2008. Graduating <em>far</em> too late (2014), I briefly worked a technical writer and worked for an IT company in the UK in 2018. I returned and found employment difficult, so decided to bite the bullet and learn IT properly!</p>
    <p>Three classes I am currently taking are:</p>
